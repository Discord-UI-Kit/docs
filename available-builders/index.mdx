    <Card title="Action Rows" icon="table-rows" href="/available-builders/action-row">
        Ah yes. The main component that holds all our components. Discord UI Kit makes them really easy to create!
    </Card>
    <Card title="Buttons" icon="toggle-on" href="/available-builders/button">
        Everyone on Discord loves buttons. They allow us to say, for example, that we agree to something, without having to use a privileged intent!
    </Card>
    <Card title="Embeds" icon="anchor" href="/available-builders/embed">
        We've all seen an embed once in our life on Discord, right? They're well formatted for bots! Discord UI Kit doesn't spare making them more fun!
    </Card>
    <Card title="Modals" icon="list-ul" href="/available-builders/modal">
        The `<form>` of Discord, much easier to use this than to edit your message over and over again with different select menus and/or using a privileged intent!
    </Card>
    <Card title="Select Menus" icon="down" href="/available-builders/select-menu">
        Sometimes a bot needs us to select something! We're making that way easier since instantiating a whole bunch of classes is way too much boilerplate!
    </Card>
    <Card title="More Coming Soon!" icon="exclamation">
        Discord UI Kit is still being actively developed, so more UI builders are possible!
