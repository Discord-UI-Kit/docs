<Warning>
    This requires `Embeds` to be part of your includes. If you initialized
    `UiClient` without any includes, it's included anyway, alongside everything
    else.
</Warning>

There are 5 types of embeds that Discord UI Kit exposes, but you can always create a fully custom one. Let's see each one!

<Note>We won't be covering the colors here since [they can be modified](/customization/customizing-colors).</Note>

    <Accordion title="Info">
        Information is a pretty big reason for an embed, you probably don't want
        to spit all that information in a single unformatted message.

        ```typescript botinfo.ts
        ```

## Custom Embed

Any custom embed is completely possible, we expose a `.custom` method specifically for that!
