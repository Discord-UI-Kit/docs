Let's say you only need our buttons kit. Well, that's easy to configure!

Let's get started!

```typescript index.ts
import { UiClient, Includes } from "@discord-ui-kit/discord.js";

const ui = new UiClient({
    include: [Includes.Buttons]
});

ui.buttons // Valid
ui.selectMenus // Invalid! Throws an error!
```

<Note>Action Rows are **always included** with this library.</Note>

<Warning>Anything **not** included will not be accessible _(besides action rows)_!</Warning>
