description: "Getting bored of the default emojis? Well, let's change that by customizing the defaults!"
---

First, make sure you've gone through at least the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and/or know how to use this library. If you do, then let's go!

**First, let's create a new file called `CustomEmojis.ts` _(or `CustomEmojis.js`, if you're using JavaScript)_.**

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="JavaScript File Creation">
        ```bash
        touch CustomEmojis.js
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="TypeScript File Creation">
        ```bash
        touch CustomEmojis.ts
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now, let's extend the base emojis!

<Danger>
Not doing this will result in either:
    - **Runtime issues (if using JavaScript)**
    - **A compile-time error (if using TypeScript)**

Remember to extend the class!
</Danger>

```typescript CustomEmojis.ts
import { UiEmojiBase } from "@discord-ui-kit/discord.js";

export default class CustomEmojis extends UiEmojiBase {
    // I want a custom check mark emoji, but how do I do that?
    // Let's keep reading!
}
```

Okay, we've overriden the class. But... how do we change the emojis? Well... every emoji in the base is just one `getter` method. The same should apply to this class.

<Accordion title="What are getter methods?">
Good question! Let's say you don't want people to change something very, very important to your project. Like your bot token!

```typescript MyBot.ts
export class MyBot {
    token: string; // Uh oh! Someone can tamper with this!

    constructor(token: string) {
        this.token = token;
    }
}
```

One way we can fix this is by making it `private`.

```typescript MyBot.ts
export class MyBot {
    private _token: string; // No one can tamper with it now, but... we can't access it outside of here!

    constructor(token: string) {
        this._token = token;
    }
}
```

But now we can't access it at all outside the class! We can use a getter method to be able to grab our token and use it for whatever though!

```typescript MyBot.ts
export class MyBot {
    private _token: string;

    constructor(token: string) {
        this._token = token;
    }

    // Now we can access it!
    public get token() {
        return this._token;
    }
}
```

<Note>It's probably better to make the field `public` and `readonly`, but this is just an example.</Note>

Now we can actually only **`GET`** that field and not tamper with it! One other cool thing about getter methods is they're exposed just like properties:

```typescript index.ts
const bot = new MyBot("some-token-here");

console.log(bot.token) // some-token-here
```

The UI library uses these instead of `public readonly` fields for the sake of making them easy to override.
</Accordion>

Let's override the check mark emoji then!

```typescript CustomEmojis.ts
import { UiEmojiBase } from "@discord-ui-kit/discord.js";

export default class CustomEmojis extends UiEmojiBase {
    public override get checkMark() {
        return "<:my_check_mark:1938129019>";
    }
}
```

<Note>Anything not overriden will stay with the default, so you don't have to override everything unless you want to.</Note>

Here, we've put `override` on the `checkMark` getter method. We're then returning a custom emoji string. This should correspond to an emoji on Discord, whether a default one or a custom one.

<Accordion title="What emojis are supported?">
It depends on your library, but in general, every library **SHOULD** be able to support:

- Unicode characters (e.g. âœ…)
- Emoji Strings (e.g. `:white_check_mark:`)
- Raw emojis (e.g. `<:my_check_mark:1938129019>`)

If your emoji is a custom one (aka, not a default one like `:white_check_mark:`), there are two conditions for using it.

- A. Your bot **has** to be a part of the server where the emoji lives.

**AND**

- B. Your bot **has** to be invited with the `Use External Emojis` permission.

Otherwise, they won't work.
</Accordion>

Now, we gotta attach this to our client.

```typescript index.ts
// ...
import CustomEmojis from "./CustomEmojis";

const ui = new UiClient({
    emojis: new CustomEmojis()
});
```

And boom! The UI kit will use your emoji class instead of the defaults!
