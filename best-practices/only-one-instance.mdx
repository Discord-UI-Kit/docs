title: Only One Instance
---

It's recommended to only have one instance of `UiClient` at a time, mainly for simplicity. You can always reuse your current client. Here's an example of how to do it.

```typescript src/index.ts
import { UiClient } from "@discord-ui-kit/discord.js";

export const ui = new UiClient(); // This will be available with an import!
```

```typescript src/commands/something-risky.ts
import { ui } from "../"; // Shorthand for ../index.ts

(async (message) => {
    const actionRow = ui.actionRows.confirmCancel("confirm", "cancel");

    await message.reply({
        content: "Are you sure? This cannot be undone!",
        components: [actionRow],
    });
})();
```
