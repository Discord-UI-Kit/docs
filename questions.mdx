    <Accordion title="Does this support Sapphire?">
        Absolutely! Sapphire builds off of `discord.js`, which is a fully
        supported library! Just install the `discord.js` version of this package
        and you're good!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Does this support Seyfert?">
        Not yet, although support **IS** planned. Seyfert is, unlike Sapphire... fully custom. The API is very similar to `discord.js`, but with some limitations. I hope to be supporting it soon though!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Will this support Eris?">
        **Short answer, maybe.**

        **Long answer:** Right now, Eris is a bit more barebones and lower-level than something like `discord.js` that exposes builders. With Eris, we'd have to manually construct components for you.
        
        That's not really on the agenda at the moment, so... not completely off the list, but not guaranteed.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why does this exist?">
        I mainly made this because making components and embeds with other
        JavaScript/TypeScript libraries results in tons of boilerplate. Which in
        turn, makes your files way longer than they need to be. Even making
        helpers yourself doesn't help, because it's basically just gonna have to
        be copy-pasted per project.
        
        **This package exists to fix that by just
        being one unified, customizable way to handle all of that!**
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Where's the API documentation?">
        You may be wondering this since, well... I haven't linked it anywhere! The API documentation is available on the actual package on JSR, since that actually documents the code for me!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why doesn't this support {other niche library}?">
        I mainly just made this to target the most popular/recently updated libraries on `npm`/`JSR`. If you want to create your own, feel free to. And feel free to publish it too for others to use! A guide _may_ be written soon to learn about how to make a custom adapter.

        **If you make a library that builds off the core, it's recommended to [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) it. But that's your choice.**
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Will this support {other language (e.g. Python or Rust)}?">
        Probably not. This is really tied into the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, which makes it hard to move things over. Plus, TypeScript is the only language I'm comfortable with. But, if you are inspired by this, feel free to use the code as a base for your own version!

        **You don't need to use the same license if you're using another language, use whatever license you like.**
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I found a bug! What should I do?">
        Finding bugs is probably gonna be very common, even with good unit tests. Report an [issue](https://codeberg.org/Discord-UI-Kit/discord-ui-kit/issues) as soon as possible to hopefully have it fixed!

        <Warning>Please do not use the GitHub repository. That is solely meant to be a mirror, not a normal repository. Any issues there will be read, but cannot be responded to.</Warning>
