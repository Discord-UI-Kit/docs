## Features of using Discord UI Kit

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fully FOSS" icon="copy">
    We pride ourselves on FOSS (Free & Open Source software). Discord UI Kit is no exception to that!

    We release this package under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) so you can do whatever you want without worrying about legal issues!

  </Card>
  <Card title="Boilerplate, be gone!" icon="circle-xmark">
    No more having to do this:

    ```typescript
    const button = new ButtonBuilder()
      .setCustomId("whatever")
      .setLabel("Whatever :(")
      .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Primary)
      // Then whatever here...
    ```

    Just use what we export:

    ```typescript
    const button = ui.buttons
      .primary("whatever", "Whatever! :)");
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extremely Customizable" icon="palette">
    Don't like some of the emojis we export? You can change them easily by [extending our base emojis class](/customization/customizing-emojis)!
    
    You can even tell the library [what to include](/)!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Framework-agnostic" icon="home">
    Whether you use `discord.js` or `eris`, `discordeno` or `harmony`, you can use this UI Kit for your projects!

    We don't judge on what library you like best, just that it works for you!
