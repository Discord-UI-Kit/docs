So... let's say you're making your own Discord bot.
You have to handle a lot of things including buttons,
modals, select menus, etc.

Meanwhile, you're repeating the same boilerplate over,
and over again.

```typescript
// Gotta make a confirm button
const confirmButton = new ButtonBuilder()
    .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Success)
    .setCustomId("confirm")
    .setLabel("Confirm")
    .setEmoji("✅");

// And then a decline button
const declineButton = new ButtonBuilder()
    .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Secondary)
    .setCustomId("decline")
    .setLabel("Decline")
    .setEmoji("❌");

// Still not done yet! Gotta add these to an action row...
const actionRow = new ActionRowBuilder().setComponents(
    confirmButton,
    declineButton,
);

// Now we can send the message, but that was just... boring.
// And my command is way too long... :(
await message.reply({
    content: "Are you sure?",
    components: [actionRow],
});
```

**Stop.** There's a better way, and that's this package!
Let's see how this package saves your command:

```typescript
const ui = new UiCore();

// This will give us an ActionRowBuilder with a confirm
// and decline button automatically!
const actionRow = ui.actionRows.confirmDecline("confirm", "decline");

// Two lines for a simple action row! :D
await message.reply({
    content: "Are you sure?",
    components: [actionRow],
});
```

See how much easier that is? Well, let's get to adding it to your project
so you can start working smarter, not harder!

## Adding to your project

Discord UI Kit is available on [JSR](https://jsr.io), and JSR only. That doesn't mean you can't use it while using NPM, Yarn, PNPM or similar though!
JSR supports all of those, even Bun!

Read through the [installation guide](/installation), then come back here.

## Using the package

Let's assume `discord.js` is being here, but this should be similar for others as well!

Remember, this guide is only gonna focus on ESM, instead of CommonJS.
If you are using CommonJS, [follow this part of the installation guide](/installation#javascript-commonjs-not-recommended).

```typescript index.ts
import { Client, Events, GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";

// First, import our UI Client.
import { UiClient } from "@discord-ui-kit/discord.js";

const client = new Client({
    intents: [
        GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
        GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
        GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
    ],
});

// Now, let's create a client! By default, everything will be included.
const ui = new UiClient();

client.on(Events.MessageCreate, async (message) => {
    if (message.content === "!something-risky") {
        // Now, we can create an action row.
        const actionRow = ui.actionRows.confirmDecline("confirm", "decline");

        // And finally, send it off!
        await message.reply({
            content: "Are you sure? This cannot be undone!",
            components: [actionRow],
        });
    }
});

client.login("whatever-token-here");
```

<Accordion title="But this package only exposes pre-made action rows? Why do that only?">
You might be asking that, since you've seen the same method twice now.
The truth is, it **doesn't** only expose pre-made action rows! Here, let's create a custom action row with multiple buttons!

```typescript index.ts
/// ...

client.on(Events.MessageCreate, async (message) => {
    if (message.content === "!bots") {
        const actionRow = ui.actionRows.multiComponents(
            ui.buttons.success("best", "They're the best! :D"),
            ui.buttons.primary("awesome", "Awesome!"),
            ui.buttons.secondary("okay", "They're okay."),
            ui.buttons.danger("nope", "I hate them. >:(")
        )

        await message.reply({
            content: "**Survey:** What is your opinion on robots?",
            components: [actionRow]
        })
    }
});
```
</Accordion>
